<h1>Hi 👋, I'm Ben</h1>

- 🔭 Hi, I’m Ben, an experienced Senior Engineer. 

- I am very confident with most front end frameworks but also equally happy with “vanilla” JavaScript APIs including web workers and custom elements. I often work with bundlers, linters, formatters and monorepo management tools.

- I do backend engineering too, both with containerised and serverless applications.

- I’m interested in platform engineering and am learning how to integrate CI tools, write bash scripts, docker files etc. I'm actively learning Kubernetes / Helm and friends.

- 📝 I write articles for print and online magazines, and have given a few conference talks. I also have my own YouTube channel.

- 💌 Open Source: I maintain [react-headroom](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/react-headroom) with [@janczizikow](https://github.com/janczizikow), and enjoy contributing to open-source projects.

- 🌱 I'm very interested in building more things with native web technologies, such as web components.

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [https://github.com/endymion1818/](https://github.com/endymion1818/)

- 📝 I regularly write articles on [https://deliciousreverie.co.uk/](https://deliciousreverie.co.uk/)

- ⚡ Outside of work: Aside from being a busy Dad, I like wild swimming, reading and spending time at the beach with friends. Aussi je parle Francais un peu. Dwi'n dysgu Cymraeg hefyd. 也会说中文.
