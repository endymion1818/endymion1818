<h1>Hi 👋, I'm Ben</h1>

- 🔭 I'm a Senior JavaScript Software Engineer with experience of FinTech and PropTech industries. I'm confident with React and friends, but I'm equally happy to work with Svelte or vanilla JavaScript. I'm one of those people who enjoy writing CSS.

- 📝 I write articles for print and online magazines, and have given a few conference talks. I also have my own YouTube channel.

- 💌 Open Source: I maintain [react-headroom](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/react-headroom) with [@janczizikow](https://github.com/janczizikow), and enjoy contributing to open-source projects.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about fullstack software engineering, and I'm very interested in building more things with native web technologies, such as web components.

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [https://github.com/endymion1818/](https://github.com/endymion1818/)

- 📝 I regularly write articles on [https://deliciousreverie.co.uk/](https://deliciousreverie.co.uk/)

- 💬 Ask me about **anything I've written about on my blog**

- 📫 How to reach me **endymion1818@gmail.com**

- ⚡ Outside of work: Dwi'n dysgu Cymraeg，也可以说中文。I like sailing and horse riding.
